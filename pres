\section{Motivation}
\begin{frame}{A live preview}
  \begin{block}{AI and the Corkscrew.}
   Did Al have an intention to put the corkscrew away that persisted from the time he acquired the intention until he put the corkscrew away?
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Assumptions}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
     Intentions exist.
  }
  \item {
    Anyone who intends to A has an intention to A.
  }
  \item {
   Some causal account or other of the production of intentional actions is correct,.
  }
  \item {
    More specifically, some such account according to which whenever agents act intentionally, at least one of the following does important causal work: some intention of theirs,
    the acquisition or persistence of some intention of theirs,
    or the neural correlate of one or more of the preceding items.
  }
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Aim}
 \begin{block}{Aim}
  Contributing to our growing understanding of the place of intentions in the lives of intelligent agents
 \end{block}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
     Developing accounts of what it is for an intention to be occurrent.
  }
  \item {
    Developing accounts of the persistence of an occurrent intention.
  }
  \item {
   Something similar alongside some proposals for relatively short-term “standing” intentions.
  }
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

% Section and subsections will appear in the presentation overview
% and table of contents.
\section{Kinds of Intention}

\begin{frame}{What is an intention?}
 \begin{block}{In what does the persistence of an intention consist?}
  Developing an account of intentions is a project in its own right, therefore for now, understand intentions however you want, given that the assumptions stated above hold true.
 \end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Proximal and Distal intentions}
\begin{frame}{Proximal Intentions}
 \begin{block}{Proximal Intentions}
   A proximal intention to A is an intention to A now. \\
   Proximal intentions also include intentions to continue doing something one is presently doing and intentions to start A-ing
 \end{block}
 \begin{example}
   An intention to answer one’s phone now \\
   An intention to start running a mile right away
  \end{example}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Distal Intentions}
 \begin{block}{Distal Intentions}
   Distal intentions are intentions agents have at a time for (and only for) action in the non-immediate future.
 \end{block}
 \begin{example}
   The intention I have now, at noon, to take my daughter to a 7:00 movie tonight.
  \end{example}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Mixed Intentions}
 \begin{block}{Mixed Intentions}
   Some intentions have both proximal and distal aspects. \\
   An intention of this kind specifies something to be done now and something to be done later.
 \end{block}
 \begin{example}
   Al may have an intention to run a mile without stopping, beginning now. (He estimates that the deed will take six minutes.)
  \end{example}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Occurent and Standing intentions}

% You can reveal the parts of a slide one at a time
% with the \pause command:
\begin{frame}{Second Slide Title}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
    My first point.
  }
  \item {
    My second point.
  }
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Persisting Occurrent Intentions}

\subsection{Another Subsection}

\section{Persisting Short-Term Standing Intentions}

% Placing a * after \section means it will not show in the
% outline or table of contents.
\section*{Summary}

\begin{frame}{Summary}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A position on \alert{what it is for an intention to be an occurrent intention at a time and an account of the persistence of occurrent intentions to A as occurrent intentions to A}.
  \item
    A sufficient condition for \alert{something’s being a standing intention to A}.
  \item
    Discussion of \alert{Relatively short-term standing intentions}.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Outlook
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Explore long term counterparts of persisting standing intentions.
    \end{itemize}
